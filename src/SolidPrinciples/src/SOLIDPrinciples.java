The SOLID principles were first conceptualized by Robert C. Martin in his 2000 paper,
Design Principles and Design Patterns.
These concepts were later built upon by Michael Feathers, who introduced us to the SOLID acronym.
And in the last 20 years, these 5 principles have revolutionized the world of object-oriented programming,
changing the way that we write software.

Design principles encourage us to create more maintainable, understandable, and flexible softwares.

As our applications grow in size, we can reduce their complexity.

The following 5 concepts make up our SOLID principles:
    1. Single Responsibility
    2. Open/Closed
    3. Liskov Substitution
    4. Interface Segregation
    5. Dependency Inversion

1. Single Responsibility - a class should only have one responsibility. (think about aspects like Testing, LowerCoupling, Organization)
2. Open/Closed           - classes should be open for extension, but closed for modification.
3. Liskov Substitution   - if class A(child) is a subtype of class B(parent), then we should be able to replace B(prent) with A(child) without disrupting the behavior of our program.
4. Interface Segregation - larger interfaces should be split into smaller ones. So, we can ensure that implementing classes only need to be concerned about the methods that are of interest to them.
5. Dependency Inversion  - The principle of Dependency Inversion refers to the decoupling of software modules.
                           This way, instead of high-level modules depending on low-level modules, both will depend on abstractions
